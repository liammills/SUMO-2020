# Engagement+
Motto: No kid left behind.

## Description
Built on ML models taught by Tensorflow, and manipulated using faceapi.js.

Engagement+ is an online learning tool that aims to fill the gap in education that online learning has created by using facial and body recognition to read the emotions of the students, as-well as their level of attention throughout the lesson. The main purpose of this product is to help teachers who teach learning disabled children over platforms such as zoom, google classroom and Microsoft teams, helping to manage students who are falling behind in their education by having a second pair of eyes helping to notify the teacher if a student isnâ€™t paying attention or is confused. This program also adds improved functionality to popular platforms, like zoom, which will be demonstrated within the presentation.
